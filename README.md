A self-project using plain Javascript (without Frameworks except using Bootstrap for CSS) to quick show Hero Index of King's Raid's.

This is my first ever project using Javascript  by self-taught, so there will be many issues in this project. This project doesn't have the best practices, but I will try my best to improve this project when I learned more in the future.
