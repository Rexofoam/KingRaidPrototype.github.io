As he smoothed out their edges, he'd feel at peace, recalling how he was when he was just learning the basics. It was just a pastime at first, but soon it became his hobby, a passion that filled his room with hundreds of sculptures. And one day, Loman started to make wooden dolls to give to his friends and his men. Back then, sorcerous dolls known to protect hearts from evil were popular in Orvelia. Loman asked an old shaman who practiced ancient folk remedies to enchant his wooden dolls with a spell of protection, and he gave them to his colleagues."
